# Bitcoin, Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Cryptocurrencies

> TODO: Add lecture notes

- "Nerd Technology" or Distributed Ledger
  - Recently the latter option
    - Potentially huge, disruptive impact, significant investment
      - There is alos a lot of hype and misinformation
    - It has a lot of interesting crypto algorithms/technology



## Blockchain

Blockchain (sometimes called Distributed Ledger) is the underlying technology on top of which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built. While cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been the original application, Blockchain technology has a much wider range of applications.

- Potential applications:
  - Finance, IoT, Energy, ...

### Digital Cash

- Not a new idea, has been around for a while
- What are properties of physical cash, that we would want in Digital Cash?
  - Forgery (counterfeit)-proof
  - Anonymity (at least to some extent)
  - Cannot be spent multiple times
    - "Double Spend" problem

```sequence
Customer->Bank: Give me coins
Bank->Customer: Coins
Customer->Merchant: Coins
Merchant->Bank: Deposit
Bank->Merchant: Ok
Merchant->Customer: Product or Service
```

- eCash Transaction
  - Each eCash coin has a unique identifier or "serial number"
- **Forgery** can be avoided by ...
  - Bank can digitally signing each coin
  - Creation of valid coin requires knowing private key, everybody can verify
- How can we avoid **double spending**?
  - In Step 4, bank checks if the coin has already been spent (keeps list of serial numbers of all issued and spent coins)
    - Each coin can only be used once
- What about **anonymity**?
  - You might not want the bank to know what you spend your eCash on.
  - Bank can trace coins. How?
    - match serial numbers of issued coins and the ones received from merchant
  - This is a bit more tricky to solve
  - Chaum's famous 1983 paper provided a new cryptographic solution
    - **Blind Signatures**

#### Blind Signatures

- Signer can provide a valid signature without seeing what he/she is signing
- How can we use Blind Signatures to solve the anonymity (untraceability) problem in eCash?
  - Customer creates a random serial number (sufficiently large to avoid collisions)
  - Sends "blinded" serial number to bank
  - Bank uses blind signature algorithm to issue a valid coin for this serial number and for the required amount, and deducts amount from user's account
    - Bank cannot see serial number!
  - Customer can then "unblind" the signature, and spend valid coin at merchant
  - Merchant sends coin to bank for checking
  - Bank checks that it is a valid coin (valid signature), and has not been spent yet, based on serial number, and adds serial number to its "spent" list
  - Important:
    - **Bank cannot link serial number in coin to the customer to whom it was issued!**



#### DigiCash

- David Chaum founded company **DigiCash** in 1989, based on eCash idea
  - Attracted a lot of venture capital initially, but struggled to attract a large customer base
  - Bought by Mercantile Bank, a large issuer of credit cards
  - DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998
  - David Chaum
    - "As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them"
  - Credit Cards remain "currency of choice" for online payments
  - One of the claimed reasons behind the failure of DigiCash and eCash
    - **Reliance in trusted third party**



### A New Approach — BitCoin

- Idea published in 2008 via a mailing list
  - Satoshi Nakamoto, "BitCoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system." (2008)
  - Implementation released as open source software in 2009
- Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym
  - It is not publicly known who that person or group is
- Newsweek is 2014 reported that they had tracked hime down, but that was not the case
- It is suggested that he/she probably owns about $10-20 Billion worth of BitCoins

#### What is it?

- Digital currency, **Cryptocurrency**
- A protocol and data structure (Blockchain)
  - Our focus
- A unit of (digital) money
  - Exchange rate is very volatile
- Digital asset and payment system

#### How does it work?

- All transactions are stored in a data base, or "public ledger"
  - Called the "blockchain"
- Public ledger is decentralised, i.e. maintained by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network
  - No need for a trusted centralised entity, e.g. bank
- Consensus is achieved through a "proof-of-work" mechanism
  - Why do we need consensus?
  - Need to agree on a common state of the ledger
- Bitcoin uses a few cryptographic "building blocks"
- We will briefly discuss/recap these

#### Bitcoin Crypto Building Blocks

- Cryptographic Hash Functions
- Hash Pointers, Blockchain
- Merkle Tress
- Proof of Work methods, "Hashcash"
- Digital Signatures



## "Blockchain Stack"

- The Blockchain can be considered a building block or platform, on top of which a wide range of applications can be built
  - Similar to TCP/IP for the Internet
- Bitcoin is just one example (the most famous) of such applications



## Cryptographic (one-way) Hash Function

- Properties of $h()$
  - Compression
    - "Any size" input, fixed size output, e.g. 256, SHA-256, used in Bitcoin
  - "Easy", "efficient" to compute
  - One-way property
    - For $y=h(x)$, it is **computationally infeasible** to find $x$
    - Also called **pre-image resistance**
  - Collision resistance
    - It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ so that $h(x_1) = h(x_2)$
      - Collisions do exist, actually there are an infinite number of them
- Also called digital fingerprint or message digest
- Compact way to remember what files or blocks of data we have seen
- If two files have the same hash, we can be confident that they are the same
- Cryptographic One-way Hash is a mouthful, from now on I will just use "hash" for short

### Ideal One-way Cryptographic Hash Function "Random Oracle" Model

- A machine with an input and an output (Blackbox)
- There is an "Elf" inside the machine, who has:
  - A very long piece of paper
  - A pen
  - An unbiased coin
- When input arrives:
  - Has the input arrived before?
    - Yes: give same output as last time (required for any function)
    - No: toss coin for new output (one toss per bit); record input and output
- Given such a hash function, what's the best approach for finding an input $x$ that has a specific output $y=h(x)$?
  - Trial-and-error, "brute force" &rarr; probabilistic
    - There is no clever way of choosing values of $x$
    - Probability of success in a single try for 256-bit hash function?
    - $P=2^{-256}$ (like rolling a $2^{256}$ sided dice)
    - The **expected** (average) number of trails to find $x$ is $2^{256}$ (rougly the estimated number of atoms in the universe)

### Hash Pointer

- Points to a block of data (e.g. via an address), like a normal pointer
- In addition, it also stores a hash $h()$ of the data
- What does $h()$ give us?
  - We can not only retrieve the data, but we can also check the **integrity** of the data, i.e. if it has been modified
