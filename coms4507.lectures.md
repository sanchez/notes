# Bitcoin, Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Cryptocurrencies

> TODO: Add lecture notes

- "Nerd Technology" or Distributed Ledger
  - Recently the latter option
    - Potentially huge, disruptive impact, significant investment
      - There is alos a lot of hype and misinformation
    - It has a lot of interesting crypto algorithms/technology



## Blockchain

Blockchain (sometimes called Distributed Ledger) is the underlying technology on top of which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built. While cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been the original application, Blockchain technology has a much wider range of applications.

- Potential applications:
  - Finance, IoT, Energy, ...

### Digital Cash

- Not a new idea, has been around for a while
- What are properties of physical cash, that we would want in Digital Cash?
  - Forgery (counterfeit)-proof
  - Anonymity (at least to some extent)
  - Cannot be spent multiple times
    - "Double Spend" problem

```sequence
Customer->Bank: Give me coins
Bank->Customer: Coins
Customer->Merchant: Coins
Merchant->Bank: Deposit
Bank->Merchant: Ok
Merchant->Customer: Product or Service
```

- eCash Transaction
  - Each eCash coin has a unique identifier or "serial number"
- **Forgery** can be avoided by ...
  - Bank can digitally signing each coin
  - Creation of valid coin requires knowing private key, everybody can verify
- How can we avoid **double spending**?
  - In Step 4, bank checks if the coin has already been spent (keeps list of serial numbers of all issued and spent coins)
    - Each coin can only be used once
- What about **anonymity**?
  - You might not want the bank to know what you spend your eCash on.
  - Bank can trace coins. How?
    - match serial numbers of issued coins and the ones received from merchant
  - This is a bit more tricky to solve
  - Chaum's famous 1983 paper provided a new cryptographic solution
    - **Blind Signatures**

#### Blind Signatures

- Signer can provide a valid signature without seeing what he/she is signing
- How can we use Blind Signatures to solve the anonymity (untraceability) problem in eCash?
  - Customer creates a random serial number (sufficiently large to avoid collisions)
  - Sends "blinded" serial number to bank
  - Bank uses blind signature algorithm to issue a valid coin for this serial number and for the required amount, and deducts amount from user's account
    - Bank cannot see serial number!
  - Customer can then "unblind" the signature, and spend valid coin at merchant
  - Merchant sends coin to bank for checking
  - Bank checks that it is a valid coin (valid signature), and has not been spent yet, based on serial number, and adds serial number to its "spent" list
  - Important:
    - **Bank cannot link serial number in coin to the customer to whom it was issued!**



#### DigiCash

- David Chaum founded company **DigiCash** in 1989, based on eCash idea
  - Attracted a lot of venture capital initially, but struggled to attract a large customer base
  - Bought by Mercantile Bank, a large issuer of credit cards
  - DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998
  - David Chaum
    - "As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them"
  - Credit Cards remain "currency of choice" for online payments
  - One of the claimed reasons behind the failure of DigiCash and eCash
    - **Reliance in trusted third party**



### A New Approach — BitCoin

- Idea published in 2008 via a mailing list
  - Satoshi Nakamoto, "BitCoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system." (2008)
  - Implementation released as open source software in 2009
- Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym
  - It is not publicly known who that person or group is
- Newsweek is 2014 reported that they had tracked hime down, but that was not the case
- It is suggested that he/she probably owns about $10-20 Billion worth of BitCoins

#### What is it?

- Digital currency, **Cryptocurrency**
- A protocol and data structure (Blockchain)
  - Our focus
- A unit of (digital) money
  - Exchange rate is very volatile
- Digital asset and payment system

#### How does it work?

- All transactions are stored in a data base, or "public ledger"
  - Called the "blockchain"
- Public ledger is decentralised, i.e. maintained by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network
  - No need for a trusted centralised entity, e.g. bank
- Consensus is achieved through a "proof-of-work" mechanism
  - Why do we need consensus?
  - Need to agree on a common state of the ledger
- Bitcoin uses a few cryptographic "building blocks"
- We will briefly discuss/recap these

#### Bitcoin Crypto Building Blocks

- Cryptographic Hash Functions
- Hash Pointers, Blockchain
- Merkle Tress
- Proof of Work methods, "Hashcash"
- Digital Signatures



## Cryptographic (one-way) Hash Function

- Properties of $h()$
  - Compression
    - "Any size" input, fixed size output, e.g. 256, SHA-256, used in Bitcoin
  - "Easy", "efficient" to compute
  - One-way property
    - For $y=h(x)$, it is **computationally infeasible** to find $x$
    - Also called **pre-image resistance**
  - Collision resistance
    - It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ so that $h(x_1) = h(x_2)$
      - Collisions do exist, actually there are an infinite number of them
- Also called digital fingerprint or message digest
- Compact way to remember what files or blocks of data we have seen
- If two files have the same hash, we can be confident that they are the same
- Cryptographic One-way Hash is a mouthful, from now on I will just use "hash" for short

### Ideal One-way Cryptographic Hash Function "Random Oracle" Model

- A machine with an input and an output (Blackbox)
- There is an "Elf" inside the machine, who has:
  - A very long piece of paper
  - A pen
  - An unbiased coin
- When input arrives:
  - Has the input arrived before?
    - Yes: give same output as last time (required for any function)
    - No: toss coin for new output (one toss per bit); record input and output
- Given such a hash function, what's the best approach for finding an input $x$ that has a specific output $y=h(x)$?
  - Trial-and-error, "brute force" &rarr; probabilistic
    - There is no clever way of choosing values of $x$
    - Probability of success in a single try for 256-bit hash function?
    - $P=2^{-256}$ (like rolling a $2^{256}$ sided dice)
    - The **expected** (average) number of trails to find $x$ is $2^{256}$ (rougly the estimated number of atoms in the universe)

### Hash Pointer

- Points to a block of data (e.g. via an address), like a normal pointer
- In addition, it also stores a hash $h()$ of the data
- What does $h()$ give us?
  - We can not only retrieve the data, but we can also check the **integrity** of the data, i.e. if it has been modified



# BlockChain

- While **Blockchain** has tremendous potential, it is "over-hyped" at the moment

```flow
op1=>operation: Don't use Blockchain
op2=>operation: Private Permissioned Blockchain
op3=>operation: Public Permissioned Blockchain
op4=>operation: Permissionless Blockchain
cond1=>condition: Do you need
to store state?
cond2=>condition: Are there
multiple writers?
cond3=>condition: Can you use
an always online
TTP?
cond4=>condition: Are all
writers known?
cond5=>condition: Are all
writers
trusted?
cond6=>condition: Is public
verifiability
required?

cond1(no)->op1
cond1(yes)->cond2
cond2(no)->op1
cond2(yes)->cond3
cond3(no)->cond4
cond3(yes,right)->op1
cond4(no,bottom)->op4
cond4(yes)->cond5
cond5(yes,right)->op1
cond5(no)->cond6
cond6(yes)->op3
cond6(no)->op2

```

- We can use hash pointers to build data structures, e.g. a linked list
  - It's called a blockchain
- Having the hash pointer to the head of the list protects the integrity of the entire list or chain (e.g. tamper proof (evident) log file)
  - Need to store hash pointer to the head of the list externally to list
- Hash is computed over entire block, including header, which includes hash pointer to previous block
- The hash of the Gensis block is stored in the next block and the hash of that block is stored in the next and so on so forth
- If an attacker wants to modify a block then all the blocks afterwards need to have their hashes regenerated otherwise the hashs won't line up. And since the head of the chain is stored somewhere, it is hard to update that



## Membership Test

- How can we verify the membership of a block $B$ in the chain?
  - e.g. in Bitcoin, we might want to check if a certain transaction is part of a block
- We need to traverse the chain from the head, until we find $h(B)$ in one of the block headers
- Cost of Linear, $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of blocks

### Merkle Trees (or Hash Trees)

- Named after Ralph Merkle

```mermaid
graph TD;

root[Merkle Root]
r11["hash(hash(B1) | hash(B2))"]
r12["hash(hash(B3) | hash(B4))"]
r21["hash(B1)"]
r22["hash(B2)"]
r23["hash(B3)"]
r24["hash(B4)"]

f1((Block1))
f2((Block2))
f3((Block3))
f4((Block4))

root-->r11
root-->r12
r11-->r21
r11-->r22
r12-->r23
r12-->r24
r21-->f1
r22-->f2
r23-->f3
r24-->f4

style f1 fill:#9f9;
style f2 fill:#9f9;
style f3 fill:#9f9;
style f4 fill:#9f9;

```

- Can protect integrity of large number of data blocks, like a Blockchain
- We only need the "Root Hash" at the root of the tree (**"Merkle Tree"**)
- Modification of any data block by attacker results in different hashes all the way up to the Merkle Root, and can easily be detected
- Cost: $O(\log_2N)$



## "Blockchain Stack"

- The Blockchain can be considered a building block or platform, on top of which a wide range of applications can be built
  - Similar to TCP/IP for the Internet
- Bitcoin is just one example (the most famous) of such applications



## Proof-of-Work-System

- A computational proof-of-work system, is a puzzle that can be solved by doing a certain amount of computation
- Properties
  - Easy to verify result
  - Easy to generate
  - Difficulty of puzzle should be adjustable and predictable (average)

### HashCash

- Approach used in Bitcoin is based on:
  - Adam Back, "Hashcash — A Denial of Service Counter-Measure", TR, 2002
- Original Goal
  - Prevent or mitigate **denial-of-service attacks** (e.g. TCP SYN flooding) or email SPAM

```sequence
Client->Server: Request Service
Server->Server: Choose
Server->Client: Challenge
Client->Client: Solve
Client->Server: Response
Server->Server: Verify
Server->Client: Grant Service
```

- Puzzle idea is based on hash function
  - Just require the first $n$ bits of $h(x)$ to have a given value, e.g. the first $n$ (most significant) bits of $y=h(x)$ are all "0" (partial pre-image)
    - Same as finding a pre-image for an $n$-bit hash function
  - Alternatively, this can be expressed as saying that $h(x)<T$
- Brute force is the best approach to solve this puzzle
- $2^n$ is the chance of getting the result on a single try and also the average number of tries before success is made
- Does it meet all the Puzzle requirements?
  - Easy to verify
    - Yes, just compute $h(x)$ and check result
  - Easy to generate
  - Difficulty is adjustable and predictable
    - Simply adjust $n$
    - Expected work factor is $2^n$
- Important
  - This is probabilistic. You could be lucky and find the answer in your first try

> In Bitcoin, the goal is to have a solution to a puzzle (confirmation of a block) roughly every 10 minutes
> Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) to maintain the 10 minute puzzle solution time



## Funding for Blockchain Ventures

- Common approach in the Blockchain context:
  - ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
  - Controversial, and extremely risky. (Banned in China and South Korea)
- In contrast to IPS (Initial Public Offering)
  - Initial offering of shares of a private company to the public
  - In contrast to ICOs, IPOs are tightly regulated



## Consensus in Distributed Systems

- This is a difficult and relatively old problem
  - Large body of research in field of distributed systems on this topic, e.g.
    - Byzantine Generals Problem
    - Paxos Protocol (famously difficult to understand and implement)
    - A lot of "impossibility results", e.g.
      - Fischer, Lynch, Paterson (FLP), "Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process"
  - Solutions are complex, include some form of voting (leader election), and typically only exist under conditions such as the following, (if at all)
    - More than 70% (or 50%, or …) of all nodes need to be honest and follow the rules, ...
  - Problem for P2P systems (with no central identity management)
    - These solutions are vulnerable to so-called =="Sybil attacks"==
      - **"… attack where a reputation system is subverted by forging identities in peer-to-peer networks."**
      - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack>

### Sybil Attack

- Named after the subject of the book **Sybil**, a case study of a woman diagnosed with *multiple personality disorder*

- *Such false identities are called =="Sybil"==*, in the context of P2P systems

- *Or =="Sockpuppets"== in the context of the Internet, e.g. to manipulate public opinion*

  - > "… referred to a false identity assumed by a member of an Internet community who spoke to, or about, themselves while pretending to be another person. 'The term now includes other misleading uses of online identities, such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organisation, to manipulate public opinion, or to circumvent a suspension or ban from a website.'"
    >
    > - Wikipedia



## Decentralised Consensus in Bitcoin

- Bitcoin achieves consensus by replacing **"one node (or one IP address) one vote"**, with **"one CPU one vote"**
- Quote from original Bitcoin paper:
  - =="Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote"==
- These days Bitcoin mining uses mostly ASICs and GPUs, not CPUs (too slow)
- Consensus is achieved by a (probabilistic) majority vote, based on computing power
  - Attacker needs > 50% of combined power in order to cheat with high probability
  - This is harder to achieve than controlling more than half of the nodes
  - It's relatively easy to spin up a few thousand VMs as nodes, compared to controlling > 50% of Bitcoin's mining compute power
- Bitcoin combines a ==proof-of-work mechanism== (based on Hashcash), combined with a clever incentive mechanism
  - Nodes get paid to do the right thing, i.e. checking and confirming valid transactions via "mining"
- New approach, not fully theoretically studied and understood, but it seems to work
  - No formal proofs, as is usually the case for analysing consensus protocols in distributed computing

> "consensus in Bitcoin works better in practice than in theory"

# Public Key Cryptography

## Digital Signatures

- Properties of signatures (in general)
  - Only **you** can provide a valid signature, anyone can verify
  - Signature is tied to a particular document, cannot be copy-pasted to another document
- Public Key Cryptography
  - Asymmetric operation
  - Two keys: **Public Key** and **Private Key**
- Encryption
  - Encryption with **Public Key**
  - Decryption with **Private Key**
  - Key Benefit (pun intended)?
    - Simplified key distribution/management
  - Remaining security problem?
    - Authenticity of public key
    - Public Key Certificates (map public key to identity)
- Digital Signature
  - Sign with Private Key
  - Verification with Public Key



### Public Key Signatures

- Since public key operations are computationally expensive, digital signatures are typically applied to a hash, rather than entire file or block of data

### Digital Signatures in Bitcoin

- Bitcoin transactions have digital signatures
  - Signed by the owner(s) of the source funds (Bitcoin to be transferred)
  - This proves ownership of funds
  - Prevents forgery of coins/transactions
- An identity in Bitcoin (a "Bitcoin Address") is simply a public key (160-bit hash of it, to be precise)
  - No need for public key certificates
  - No need to link public key to a real name
- Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm



# Cryptocurrecny

- One global whiteboard example (Classroom Example from lecture) is essentially how Bitcoin works
- Difference
  - We cannot assume people are in the same physical location
  - A cryptocurrency should work over the Internet
- How can we achieve
  - Broadcasting of transactions
    - Untrusted P2P Network, flooding (as used in Bitcoin)
  - Avoiding forgery (transactions, coins)
    - Digital Signatures
  - Maintaining the public ledger
    - P2P Network
    - **Proof-of-work system + Incentive mechanism &rarr; distributed consensus**




# Bitcoin

## Bitcoin Summary

- Complete transaction history is stored in public ledger (blockchain), sotred by nodes in P2P network
- New transactions are created off-line, and then broadcast is P2P network
- Nodes validate and relay transactions (if valid)
- Nodes add new transactions in pool to a block, and try to colve the corresponding proof-of-work puzzle, to "confirm" the block
- Node that finds solution first broadcasts block with solution in the network
  - Winning node selection is probabilistic, with probability proportional to computing power
- Nodes check solution, and if OK, add new block to their local copy of blockchain
- All nodes who were working on solving the old puzzle, immediately start working on a new block
  - Everybody always works on the longest chain
  - Convergence to longest chain provides consensus
  - Forks happen but are resolved by (computational) majority vote



## Bitcoin Components

- Bitcoin Network
- Bitcoin  Identities/Addresses
- Bitcoin Transactions
- Bitcoin Scripting Language
- Blocks
- Proof-of-work, Hash puzzles, Mining
- Consensus

### Bitcoin Network

- Transactions are broadcast in the Bitcoin network, consisting of "full" Bitcoin nodes (~10,000)
  - Best-effort (asynchronous, unreliable), it's enough if only some nodes get the message
  - It's easy to join the Bitcoin Network, just download and run the client
    - And download the blockchain, ~160GB (<https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size>)
    - <http://bitcoin.org/en/full-node>
    - Bitcoin is a **permissionless**, **public** blockchain, anyone can join
- Network is unstructured P2P network (random topology)
  - Similar to Gnutella (a P2P system from a long time ago)
  - Overlay network, TCP, port 8333
  - Messages are flooded
  - All nodes are equal, no hierarchy
  - Nodes can join at any time
  - Node is "forgotten" if it does not respond for more than 3 hours
  - Network is very simple and robust, e.g. to churn, but not very efficient
- Current view of the Bitcoin Network: <https://bitnodes.21.co>

#### Bitcoin Network Nodes

- Role of Nodes
  - Check validity of **transactions**
    - e.g. check signatures,
      - or whatever is defined in the Bitcoin script attached to the transaction
    - Check that this is note a double spend attempt
  - Relay **transactions** in the network via flooding
  - Mining
    - Solve proof-of-work puzzles for block of transactions
      - Block of transactions with solved puzzle is considered "confirmed"
  - Validate and forward **confirmed blocks**
    - Add them to local copy of blockchain



### Identity and Addresses

- Users are represented by their Public Key addresses (hash), called **Bitcoin Addresses**, which serve as a pseudonyms
  - An address is a **160 bit** value, and is computed as follows
  - RIPEMD160 hash of SHA-256 hash of ECDSA Public Key
  - This is a **"Pay-to-pubkey-hash (P2PKH)"** address, encoding starts with **"1"**
- When spending a coin, spender needs to proof ownership of coin by providing a valid digital signature on the spend transaction
  - i.e. proving ownership of corresponding private key
- How can digital signatures be verified?
  - We need public key, not just hash of public key
  - Spender of coin needs to provide both valid signature AND public key
  - How do we know the provided public key is authentic?
    - Hash it, and compare with Bitcoin address, which is the hash of public key
- Bitcoin also supports **Pay to script hash (P2SH)** addresses
  - Allow transactions to be sent to a **script hash** instead of a public key hash
    - Address encoding starts with a **"3"** instead of **"1"**
  - To spend bitcoins sent via P2SH, the recipient must provide a script matching the script hash and data which makes the script evaluate to true
  - Allows more complex transactions (**smart contracts**), e.g. transaction outputs that require multiple signatures (multisig), or transaction puzzle, ...

#### Bitcoin Address Encoding

- Bitcoin uses Base58 encoding (binary-to-text encoding)

- Similar to Base64 encoding, bit without some characters

  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>

- Rationale, as explained in original bitcoin client source code

  - > Why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
    >
    > - Don't want 0O1I characters that look the same in some fontsand could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.
    > - A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account nbr.
    > - E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break it.
    > - Double-clicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric

- Main aim: avoid potential ambiguity, e.g. 0 vs O, 1 vs I, etc

- Bitcoin also adds 4 byte checksum to addresses

#### Balance

- The "balance" of an address is the total of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) sent to the address

> "There are no accounts or balances in bitcoin; there are only *unspent transaction outputs (UTXO)* scattered in the blockchain"
>
> - <http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/ch05.html#tx_structure>

- A user typically has many different addresses, all managed by the "wallet" software
- The wallet "balance" is the sum of all unspent transaction outputs of all addresses owned by the user



### Transactions

- Transactions are created off-line
  - No need to be connected to Bitcoin network for thise
  - Like writing a cheque
- Transactions are broadcast in Bitcoin P2P network
- Nodes check validity, and relay transaction (flooding)
- Nodes add to new transactions to a block and try to solve hash puzzle
- A block with a solved puzzle is "confirmed", and broadcast in the network, and added to the blockchain of each node
- Similar to ==SimpleCoin_v2== transactions
  - Inputs (any number &geq; 0)
  - Outputs (any number > 0)
    - Contain Bitcoin Address(es) of recipient(s)
  - Digital signatures of input coin owners
    - Typically (for **P2PKH** transactions)
  - Input needs to be completely consumed
    - With exception of Transaction Fee (discuessed later)
- We now look at the most common transaction types in terms of number of inputs and outputs

#### Basic Transaction Types

- Common Transaction
  - 1 input
  - 1 "normal" output
  - 1 change output (back to owner)
- Aggregating Transaction
  - Multiple inputs
  - 1 output
- Distributing Transaction
  - 1 input
  - Multiple outputs
- =="Coinbase Transaction"==
  - 0 input, 1 outputs
  - Freshly created ("minted") coins
  - Miner gets this as a reward for solving Hash puzzle (and thereby confirming block)
  - First transaction in every block



### Bitcoin Scripting Language

- Two types of Bitcoin scripts to validate transactions
  - a locking script
    - Typically ==ScriptPubKey==
  - and an unlocking script
    - Typically ==ScriptSig==
- A locking script is a condition placed on an output
- It specifies the conditions that must be met to spend or consume the output in the future
  - Typically a ==valid digital signature== of the claimed owner
  - Can be other things, to implement basic 'smart contracts'
- <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script>
- Allows to program conditions required for the spending of Bitcoins
  - "Programmable Money"
  - Most common scripts are ==ScriptSig== and ==ScriptPubKey==
- **Script** is a simple, stack based language
- Scripts are guaranteed to terminate after a fixed number of steps, e.g. no infinite loops
- Why is this a good thing?
  - Avoids potential denial of service attacks on nodes, "logic bombs"
  - Remember: Every node runs all scripts to validate all transactions
    - BTW, this severely limits scalability of Bitcoin
- In contrast, Ethereum has a Turing complete scripting language
  - Solves DoS attack problem by putting a price on script computation (=="Gas"==)



### Blocks

- Transactions are grouped into blocks
  - This is an optimisation. Confirming individual transactions and adding them to the blockchain would be possible, but very inefficient
- Transactions are stored in a Merkle Tree, with the Merkle Root (Tx_Root) stored in the block header
- Once confirmed (via solving hash puzzle), a block is added to the blockchain
- The "Nonce" is the solution of the hash puzzle

#### How are blocks added to the Blockchain?

- Multiple nodes (miners) are working towards solving the hash puzzle for a new block
  - miners are probably working on different version of blocks, depending on content on their transaction pool
- First node who solves puzzle, broadcasts new block with solution (nonce) in the Bitcoin P2P network
  - Choice of winning node is random (**probabilistic**)
  - Probability of success is proportional to computing power of miner
- =="Block Height"== is sequence number of blocks
- Other nodes check if solution is correct, and if so, add block to their local copy of the blockchain, and forward new block to other nodes

#### Solving the Hash Puzzle (Mining)

- Puzzle
  - Find "nonce", so that $h(\text{block header}) < \text{Target Value}$
    - This is the same as requiring that the first $n$ (most significant) bits are $0$
    - nonce is part of block header
    - Bitcoin uses ==SHA256(SHA256(block header))==
  - Best approach to solve puzzle
    - Try different values for **nonce**, (trial and error)
- Difficulty (via value $n$) is adjusted every 2016 blocks
- Goal: keep average solving time at ~10 minutes



### Proof-of-work, Hash Puzzles, Mining

- At the current level of difficulty, solving Bitcoin hash puzzles is hard and expensive
  - Hardware
  - Electricity
- Mostly ASICs based, some GPUs
- Total hash rate of entire Bitcoin network
  - Approximately $25\times 10^{18}$
- What's the has rate of my laptop (Intel i7 CPU), and should I attempt to mine bitcoins?
  - $\approx10 MH/s$

#### Mining Incentive/Reward

- ==Transaction Fees==
  - Difference between total input and total output value of transaction
  - Is optional, but miners prioritise inclusion of transactions into blocks based on fees
    - Like giving a tip
    - Wallet software handles that for you, but you can also set it
- ==Block Reward==
  - For each solved puzzle (confirmation of block), miner currently gets freshly minted 12.5 BTC
  - "Coinbase transation" (1^st^ transation in each block)
  - This is the only way in which coins are generated in Bitcoin
  - This reward is halved every 4 years
    - Initially 50 BTC per block
  - What does that mean for the total supply of Bitcoins?

#### Transation Fee

- Assume you use an unspent transaction output of 1 BTC to pay 1 Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), and you forget to add a Change Transaction
- That's like saying to the miner, "Keep the Change"
  - Miner who confirms blocks will keep the difference between inputs and outputs as Transaction Fee
  - However, your wallet software should handle that, so you generally don't need to worry about this

#### Max Number of Bitcoin

$$
\sum^\infty_{k=0}ar^k = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots = \frac{a}{1-r}
$$

- Total amount is finite (~21 Million BTC)
  - Geometric series converges
  - There will essentially be no more Block Reward in 2040
- Will transaction fees alone provide sufficient incentive for mining?
  - Bitcoin is deflationary
    - Value increases, people are potentially hoarding Bitcoin
    - Generally not a desirable *property* for a currency



### Consensus

- Blockchain forks can happen, e.g. due to race conditions and variable latency in Bitcoin network (**two nodes might find a solution to the puzzle at almost the same time**), or due to double spend attempt
- Nodes converge on one chain, they all aim to work on the longest (main) chain, and eventually one chain wins
- Incentive to work on the longest chain
  - Block Reward and TX fees can only be spent if block remains in the longest chain (need a certain number of **confirmations**, i.e. blocks added)
- Blocks on discontinued branches are called "orphaned blocks"
- Heuristic
  - Transactions are considered "confirmed" if they are in a block that has at least 6 blocks added to the chain (i.e. 6 confirmations)
    - There is nothing special about the number 6
- This means if someone wanted to reverse a transaction, they would have to go back 6 blocks, and re-do all the hash puzzles, before another nodes adds a new block at the end of chain
  - Practically impossible (probabilistic), unless attacker has more than 50% of computing power of entire network
    - So called =="50% attack"==
- What else can an attacker try to do?
  - Publish an invalid transaction, e.g. trying to spend coins that he does not own (no valid signature)
    - All honest/conforming nodes will reject that transaction, and will not try to confirm it (solve puzzle)
    - Attacker would need to control > 50% of all computing power in the network to ensure that invalid transaction stays in the longest chain with high probability
  - Double spend attack
    - This will cause a fork in the blockchain
    - Majority vote (in terms of computing power) will guarantee that only one chain will exist, eventually
      - There is no "moral" judgement on which of the two spends is the right one and which one is the wrong one, but that does not really matter
      - The main point is there there is guaranteed convergence to one chain
    - Launch DoS attack against (with > 50% of computing power)
- With that much computing power, a rational "attacker" is better off playing by the rules, i.e. by earning Block Rewards and transaction fees
