## Course Focus

- Basic Information Security concepts
  - Not how to use the latest version of Metasploit, Nessus, Nmap, etc
- Generally, focus more on information with a longer **"half-life"**
- What's "half-life"?
  - The amount of time required to halve a given metric
  - Half-life is constant for exponential decay, e.g. radio avtive decay
  - Sometimes used informally to discuss decay of relevance of information



# Internet of Things (IoT)

- Information Security is not just about securring servers, desktops, and smartphones, but also *things* like applicances, light bulbs, pacemakers, cars, etc.
- "Cisco estimated that 50 billion devices and object will be connected to the Internet by 2020"



# Security

- What is security?
- Webster Online Dictionary:
  - Security: "the quality or state of being secure"
  - Secure: "free from risk of loss"
- Security is about dealing with the potential loss of or damage to **assests**
- From a Business Perspective, potential damage to assests is treated as a **Risk**
- General ==Risk Management== methods can be applied



## How to Deal with Risk

- As a business, how can you deal with Risks
- Three things you can do with a Risk:
  - Accept it
    - e.g. We accept the risk of a meteorite impact
  - Transfer it
    - Insurance (Fire, Burglary, etc)
  - Reduce (mitigate or "treat") it
    - reduce likelihood and/or impact
    - How can we do this here?
      - Alarm system, Guards, etc
      - Install a sprinkler system

> This cource is mainly about the third option
>
> - Reducing the risk of "damage" to **information assets** by means of **Protective Measures**



### Types of Protective Measures

- **Preventative** Measures
  - Prevent assets from being "damaged"
- **Detective** Measures
  - Allow detection **when** an assets has been "damaged", **how** it has been damaged and **who** caused it
- **Reactive** Measures
  - Allow recovery from "damage" to assets

#### Protective Measures

- You want to protect valuable items inside your home from burglary
- **Preventative** Measures, Examples?
  - Door locks, window bars, a moat (?)
- **Detective** Measures, Examples?
  - Burglar Alarm, Security cameras
- **Reactive** Measures, Examples?
  - Call the police



## Information Security

- **Security** is about dealing with potential "damage" to assets
- What is **Information Security**?
  - Deals with potential "damage" to **information assets**
- The aim is to protect information assets from "damage"
- How can information assets be "damaged" or compromised?
- Information Assets can be compromised or "damaged" in terms of:
  - **Confidentially, Privacy, Secrecy**
    - Prevention of unauthorised disclosure of information
  - **Integrity**
    - Prevention of unauthorised modification of information
  - **Availability**
    - Prevention of unauthorised withholding of information or services



### Aspects of Information Security

- Definitions of aspects of **Information Security** vary
- Most commonly, it is defined as the following 5 aspects:
  - Confidentiality, Privacy, Secrecy
  - Integrity
  - Availability
  - **Authenticity**
    - Making sure the author/sender of a message is as it is claimed
    - Example for an attack on Authenticity?
      - Email with forged sender address (Phishing Example)
  - **Non-repudiation**
    - Non-repudiation ensures that the maker of a statement, or signer of a contract, will not be able to successfully challenge the validity of the statement or contract
    - How can non-repudiation be implemented, in general and in the context of Information Security?
      - signatures, digital signatures

### Risk Management

> "The process concerned with **identification**, **measurement**, **control** and **minimisation** of security risks in information systems to a level commensurate with the value of the assets protected."

- Risk management helps information systems (IS) management strike an (informed) **economic balance** between the impact of risks and the cost of protective measures
- Risk management is the total process of identifying, measuring, controlling, and minimising or eliminating the likelihood and/or impact of an attack
- It includes risk assessment; cost benefit analysis; selection, implementation, and evaluation of security features and countermeasures; and an overall security review

#### Risk — A Definition

> "The likelihood that a particular *threat* using a specific attack, will exploit a particular *vulnerability* of system that results in an undesirable consequence."

#### Threat — A Definition

> "Any *circumstance* or *event* with the potential to cause harm to an information system in the form of destruction, disclosure, adverse modification of data, and/or the denial of service."

#### Vulnerability — A Definition

> "*Weakness* in an information system, cryptographic system, or other components (e.g… system security procedures, hardware design, internal controls) that could be exploited by a threat."

Examples:

- Un-patched web server
- Lack of firewall
- Unlocked door

#### Risk Assessment (Risk Analysis/Evaluation)

> "A process of analysing *threats* to, and *vulnerabilities* of, an information system and the *potential impact* the loss of information or capabilities of a system would have. The resulting analysis is used as a basis for **identifying appropriate and cost-effective counter-measures**"

## Risk Management

- Three things to with a Risk
  - Accept it
  - Transfer it &rarr; Insurance
  - Reduce it &rarr; Risk Mitigation
    - Apply "security controls"
      - safeguards or countermeasures to reduce risk
    - Examples in the context of Information Security:
      - Install a firewall, IDS, IPS, ...
      - User Training
      - Guard dogs
      - Create a Security Policy
- "Residual Risk":
  - The propertion of Risk that remains after security measures have been applied
- IT Manager have limited resources to spend on security
- Risk Management helps to determine how these resource can be used **most efficiently**

### Quantitative Risk Analysis

- We would like some **quantitative** description of Risk *(or Risk Magnitude)*
- $\text{Risk} = \text{Expected Cost of Damage} = \text{Impact}\times\text{Likelihood}$
- Two main questions:
  - What's the probability of a loss event occurring?
    - Probability of a major flood in Brisbane in the next year $\approx1\%$
    - Can be based on historical data
  - What's the impact (loss) in terms of $?
    - Unavailability of a company web site for one day might result in $100,000 of lost business
    - Leaking of secret Coca-Cola recipe &rarr; Millions of dollars

#### Quantitiative Risk Analysis Parameters

- ARO (Annualised Rate of Occurrence)
  - Expected number of times a loss event occurs within a year
- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
  - The impact (loss) of a loss event occurring in $
- ALE (Annualised Loss Expectancy)
  - Expected (average) loss per year due to a Risk

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Risk Analysis

- In practice, it is often very difficult to
  - Assign probabilities to loss events
  - Quantify the cost/impact of loss events
- Often, qualitative methods are used
- If Risks cannot be quantified, they are often ranked: highest to lowest




# Trust

## The Concept of Trust

- The concept of **Trust** and **Trustworthiness** are fundamental for Information Security
- **Trust** according to the Oxford Dictionary:

> "Confidence, strong belief, in the goodness, strength, reliability of something or somebody",
> "responsibility"

- What does it mean to trust somebody/something?

## Trust vs Trustworthiness

- What is the difference between **trusted** and **trustworthy**?

## Direct and Indirect Trust

- Trust can be based on direct experience
- What if two people want to do business but have never met or communicated before? How can they establish a level of trust?
  - Via indirect experience or recommendation
  - Trent tells Bob that Alice is trustworthy. If Bob trusts Trent, this trust is transferred to Alice. (Trent acts as a so-called *Trusted Third Party*)



# Information Security

- Information Security is about protecting information assets
- Information assets need to be protected to provide (5 aspects of Information Security):
  - **Confidentiality**
  - **Integrity**
  - **Availability**
  - Authenticity (Integrity of provenance)
  - Non-repudiation (Integrity of action/timeline)
- We need to control who has access to information
  - **Access Control**



## Access Control

- Lack of Access control can lead to **Confidentiality**, **Integrity** and **Availability** (CIA) being compromised
- We need to control who can read, write and modify data
- What is an access control decision in Information Secruity typically based on?
  - Mostly identity
- 2 separate functions:
  - Establish Identity (Identification and Authentication)
    - **Identification:** Determine identity (person or machine)
    - **Authentication:** Verify identity (proof)
  - Authorisation
    - Once the identity of a person is known, a decision can be made about granting or denying access
      - Identity is often linked to a "Role" &rarr; Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
- In Information Security, access control is typically based on **Identity**
- Identification and Authentication are crucial
- It also allows to create an audit trail &rarr; Accountability



## Authentication

> "The process of verifying a claimed identity"
>
> - Authentication provides proof of identity

- How can this proof be provided?
  *(3 general types of mechanisms)*
  - With something you **know**
    - Password, PIN
  - With something you **have**
    - Physical key, token, smart card, ...
  - With something you **ar (or do)**
    - Unique characteristic of human body
    - e.g. fingerprint, voice, hand geometry … (Biometrics)



### Passwords

- Most common method for Authentication
  - "something you know"
- Problems with passwords:
  - Users forget passwords
    - Too many passwords to remember
  - Users choose same password for multiple systems
    - If one system is compromised, all systems are compromised
  - Users choose weak or guessable passwords
    - Problem: Easy to remember passwords are often also easy to guess
  - Users write passwords on Post-it notes and stick them to their computer screen
  - Failure to reset default password

#### Default Passwords

- These days, are there still computers/devices running services with default passwords connected to the Internet? Surely not
- "Carna Botnet"
  - ~500,000 devices compromised via services such as Telnet, with default or no passwords
  - Mostly small (embedded) devices, IP cameras, routers, etc. (IoT)
- Purpose
  - "Internet Census 2012"
  - Internet wide port scan of all IPv4 addresses
  - Collection of huge data set

> "Two years ago while spending time with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) someone mentioned that we should try the classic telnet login `root:root` on random IP addresses. This was meant as a joke, but was given a try. We started scanning and  quickly realised that there should be several thousand unprotected devices on the Internet"
> [http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html](http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html)

- BTW, `nmap` is a widely used security scanner or "port scanner", used for **"Pen Testing"**



#### Attacks against Passwords

- What are possible attacks to "find" a user's password?
- Password guessing
  - Brute force, dictionary attacks
  - Online, offline
- Social Engineering
  - You get a phone call from somebody claiming he/she is the sysadmin and needs your password to reset your account
    - "Phishing attacks" &rarr; get users' credentials (identity theft)
- Eavesdropping
  - Some (insecure) applications send password in cleartext over the network (ftp, telnet, http) &rarr; "Network sniffer", e.g. *wireshark*
- "Shoulder surfing"
  - Somebody is watching you when you enter the password
- Bogus (fake) Interface
  - Attack program looks like normal login screen and records login and password of users
  - Windows has a **"secure attention sequence"**: CTRL-ALT-DEL
  - Guaranteed to go to genuine login screen
  - A facility that guarantees a user is talking to the real system is called a **"Trusted Path"**
    - If you are security conscious, it's a good idea to always press `CTRL-ALT-DEL` before you log in
- Key stoke loggers, or "keyloggers"
  - Record everything you type on your keyboard, including passwords
  - Can be hardware or software based
  - Can be distributed as a Malware
- Attacks via Audit Trail
  - Systems typically log failed password attempts
  - Contain a lot of passwords, since users get login, password sequence mixed up
  - Non-existent user names like *e5gv*, *8yp* are likely to be valid passwords
  - &rarr; restrict access to log files

#### Attacks against Password Storage

- Problem:
  - Passwords need to be stored somewhere, needed by the system during login process
    - &rarr; vulnerability
- Originally, computer passwords were stored in plaintext, i.e. unencrypted
- How can we solve this problem?
  - Solution by Needham and Guy
    - Store "encrypted" passwords
- What is the problem with using standard encryption?
  - Passwords need to be decrypted with a secret key when users log in
  - At that stage, password (or key) is vulnerable
  - Also, how so we store the secret key?
- Solution:
  - Store a **cryptographic one-way hash** of password $p: h(p)$
  - Access to $h(p)$ allows the OS to verify the password
  - Access to $h(p)$ does not allow finding $p$
  - **Cryptographic one-way hash functions** are a very important building block for a large number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols



## Cryptographic (One-way) Hash Functions

- A **hash function** $h()$ is a function with the following two properties
  - **Compression:** $h()$ maps an input $x$ of arbitrary finite bit length to an output $h(x)$ of fixed, typically short, bit length
  - **Ease of computation:** Given $h()$ and an input $x$, it is easy to compute $h(x)$
- A **one-way hash function** has the additional **one-way property**
  - For essentially all outputs $y=h(x)$, it is "computationally infeasible" (practically impossible) to find $x$
  - Also called "pre-image resistance"
- A **cryptographic one-way hash function** is a one-way hash function with the additional property of =="Collision Resistance"==
  - "Strong Collision Resistance"
    - It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ so that $h(x_1) = h(x_2)$
  - "Weak Collision Resistance" or "2^nd^-pre-image resistance"
    - For a given output $y=h(x_1)$, it is infeasible to find another input $x_2$ so that $h(x_1)=h(x_2)$
      - This is harder than in the above case, therefore resistance to this is only a "weak resistance"
- Collision resistance is crucial for the security of algorithms and protocols, e.g. digital signatures
- Also called "digest function" or "digital fingerprint"
- Examples:
  - md5 (message digest) — output is 128 bits
  - SHA-1 ("secure" hash algorithm) — output is 160 bits
- A cryptographic hash function is considered "broken" if collisions can be found with significantly less work than brute force
- Both md5 and SHA-1 are considered broken
- Algorithms considered (practically) secure, so far:
  - SHA-2
    - Different bit lengths, up to 512 &rarr; SHA-512
  - SHA-3
    - Announced the **Keccak Algorithm** as the winner of the 5 year NIST *(National Institute for Standards and Technology)* competition, October 2012



### An Ideal Model of a Cryptographic One-way Hash Function

- A machine with an input and an output
- There is an "Elf" inside the machine, who has:
  - A very long piece of paper
  - A pen
  - An unbiased coin
- When input arrives:
  - Has this input arrived before?
    - Yes: give same output as last time (required by any function)
    - No: toss coin for new output (one toss per bit); record input and output
- Everyone has access to this machine
- This ideal model is called a **"Random Oracle Model"** and is often used to proof certain properties of cryptographic systems
- Important property:
  - Similar but not identical input files will most likely result in completely different hash values



### Pre-image Attack

- "Work factor" to find a "pre-image", for a n-bit hash function (random oracle model)
  - i.e. for a ==given output $h(x_1)$== find $x_2$ so that $h(x_1)=h(x_2)$
  - Under the random oracle model, what's the best approach to find a pre-image?
    - "brute force" attack i.e. randomly trying different inputs
- Inputs are randomly mapped to outputs. There are $2^n$ possible outputs
- On average, how many different inputs do we have to try to find a collision?
  - On average, we can expect to find a pre-image after trying **2^n^** different inputs
    - work factor
  - This is like throwing $2^n$ sided dice. For $n=3$, we have an 8 sided dice. On average, we have to roll the dice 8 times to get a particular result
  - Due to the random mapping, randomly picking inputs is like randomly picking the outputs
- For $n=128$ and if we use 1 billion computers that can compute 1 billion hash values a second each, how long will it take on average to find a pre-image, for $h(x_1)$, i.e. an input $x_2$ for which $h(x_2)=h(x_1)$?
  - About 20,000 billion years



### Collision Attack

- Finding a collision *between any two inputs*:
  - "Collision Attack"
  - Harder or easier than pre-image attack?
    - Much, much easier than pre-image attack
  - Work factor: $2^\frac{n}{2}$ (Birthday Paradox)



### Finding Hash Collisions or Pre-images

- How can you (legally) make money finding hash collisions/Pre-images
- Bitcoin mining
  - Finding an input with the first $n$ bits of the hash output being a specific value ("proof-of-work")
  - Can adjust difficulty by changing $n$
- A lot of effort has gone into building efficient systems for calculating hashes

#### Possible Attacks using Hash Collisions (Pre-images)

- Most digitial signature algorithms involve hashing a file before a signature is applied
  - For performance reasons
- Let's assume Alice has a file $F1$ that she wants to digitally sign. She computes $h(F1)$ and then computes the signature
  - $sig(h(F1))$
- How can Bob use a pre-image attack to create a fake signature?
  - He can find a file $F2$ with $h(F1)=h(F2)$
  - He can then present $F2$ together with Alice's signature $sig(h(F1))=sig(h(F2))$ and claim that she signed the file $F2$
