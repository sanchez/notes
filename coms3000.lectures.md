## Course Focus

- Basic Information Security concepts
  - Not how to use the latest version of Metasploit, Nessus, Nmap, etc
- Generally, focus more on information with a longer **"half-life"**
- What's "half-life"?
  - The amount of time required to halve a given metric
  - Half-life is constant for exponential decay, e.g. radio avtive decay
  - Sometimes used informally to discuss decay of relevance of information



# Internet of Things (IoT)

- Information Security is not just about securring servers, desktops, and smartphones, but also *things* like applicances, light bulbs, pacemakers, cars, etc.
- "Cisco estimated that 50 billion devices and object will be connected to the Internet by 2020"



# Security

- What is security?
- Webster Online Dictionary:
  - Security: "the quality or state of being secure"
  - Secure: "free from risk of loss"
- Security is about dealing with the potential loss of or damage to **assests**
- From a Business Perspective, potential damage to assests is treated as a **Risk**
- General ==Risk Management== methods can be applied



## How to Deal with Risk

- As a business, how can you deal with Risks
- Three things you can do with a Risk:
  - Accept it
    - e.g. We accept the risk of a meteorite impact
  - Transfer it
    - Insurance (Fire, Burglary, etc)
  - Reduce (mitigate or "treat") it
    - reduce likelihood and/or impact
    - How can we do this here?
      - Alarm system, Guards, etc
      - Install a sprinkler system

> This cource is mainly about the third option
>
> - Reducing the risk of "damage" to **information assets** by means of **Protective Measures**



### Types of Protective Measures

- **Preventative** Measures
  - Prevent assets from being "damaged"
- **Detective** Measures
  - Allow detection **when** an assets has been "damaged", **how** it has been damaged and **who** caused it
- **Reactive** Measures
  - Allow recovery from "damage" to assets

#### Protective Measures

- You want to protect valuable items inside your home from burglary
- **Preventative** Measures, Examples?
  - Door locks, window bars, a moat (?)
- **Detective** Measures, Examples?
  - Burglar Alarm, Security cameras
- **Reactive** Measures, Examples?
  - Call the police



## Information Security

- **Security** is about dealing with potential "damage" to assets
- What is **Information Security**?
  - Deals with potential "damage" to **information assets**
- The aim is to protect information assets from "damage"
- How can information assets be "damaged" or compromised?
- Information Assets can be compromised or "damaged" in terms of:
  - **Confidentially, Privacy, Secrecy**
    - Prevention of unauthorised disclosure of information
  - **Integrity**
    - Prevention of unauthorised modification of information
  - **Availability**
    - Prevention of unauthorised withholding of information or services



### Aspects of Information Security

- Definitions of aspects of **Information Security** vary
- Most commonly, it is defined as the following 5 aspects:
  - Confidentiality, Privacy, Secrecy
  - Integrity
  - Availability
  - **Authenticity**
    - Making sure the author/sender of a message is as it is claimed
    - Example for an attack on Authenticity?
      - Email with forged sender address (Phishing Example)
  - **Non-repudiation**
    - Non-repudiation ensures that the maker of a statement, or signer of a contract, will not be able to successfully challenge the validity of the statement or contract
    - How can non-repudiation be implemented, in general and in the context of Information Security?
      - signatures, digital signatures

### Risk Management

> "The process concerned with **identification**, **measurement**, **control** and **minimisation** of security risks in information systems to a level commensurate with the value of the assets protected."

- Risk management helps information systems (IS) management strike an (informed) **economic balance** between the impact of risks and the cost of protective measures
- Risk management is the total process of identifying, measuring, controlling, and minimising or eliminating the likelihood and/or impact of an attack
- It includes risk assessment; cost benefit analysis; selection, implementation, and evaluation of security features and countermeasures; and an overall security review

#### Risk — A Definition

> "The likelihood that a particular *threat* using a specific attack, will exploit a particular *vulnerability* of system that results in an undesirable consequence."

#### Threat — A Definition

> "Any *circumstance* or *event* with the potential to cause harm to an information system in the form of destruction, disclosure, adverse modification of data, and/or the denial of service."

#### Vulnerability — A Definition

> "*Weakness* in an information system, cryptographic system, or other components (e.g… system security procedures, hardware design, internal controls) that could be exploited by a threat."

Examples:

- Un-patched web server
- Lack of firewall
- Unlocked door

#### Risk Assessment (Risk Analysis/Evaluation)

> "A process of analysing *threats* to, and *vulnerabilities* of, an information system and the *potential impact* the loss of information or capabilities of a system would have. The resulting analysis is used as a basis for **identifying appropriate and cost-effective counter-measures**"

## Risk Management

- Three things to with a Risk
  - Accept it
  - Transfer it &rarr; Insurance
  - Reduce it &rarr; Risk Mitigation
    - Apply "security controls"
      - safeguards or countermeasures to reduce risk
    - Examples in the context of Information Security:
      - Install a firewall, IDS, IPS, ...
      - User Training
      - Guard dogs
      - Create a Security Policy
- "Residual Risk":
  - The propertion of Risk that remains after security measures have been applied
- IT Manager have limited resources to spend on security
- Risk Management helps to determine how these resource can be used **most efficiently**

### Quantitative Risk Analysis

- We would like some **quantitative** description of Risk *(or Risk Magnitude)*
- $\text{Risk} = \text{Expected Cost of Damage} = \text{Impact}\times\text{Likelihood}$
- Two main questions:
  - What's the probability of a loss event occurring?
    - Probability of a major flood in Brisbane in the next year $\approx1\%$
    - Can be based on historical data
  - What's the impact (loss) in terms of $?
    - Unavailability of a company web site for one day might result in $100,000 of lost business
    - Leaking of secret Coca-Cola recipe &rarr; Millions of dollars

#### Quantitiative Risk Analysis Parameters

- ARO (Annualised Rate of Occurrence)
  - Expected number of times a loss event occurs within a year
- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
  - The impact (loss) of a loss event occurring in $
- ALE (Annualised Loss Expectancy)
  - Expected (average) loss per year due to a Risk

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Risk Analysis

- In practice, it is often very difficult to
  - Assign probabilities to loss events
  - Quantify the cost/impact of loss events
- Often, qualitative methods are used
- If Risks cannot be quantified, they are often ranked: highest to lowest




# Trust

## The Concept of Trust

- The concept of **Trust** and **Trustworthiness** are fundamental for Information Security
- **Trust** according to the Oxford Dictionary:

> "Confidence, strong belief, in the goodness, strength, reliability of something or somebody",
> "responsibility"

- What does it mean to trust somebody/something?

## Trust vs Trustworthiness

- What is the difference between **trusted** and **trustworthy**?

## Direct and Indirect Trust

- Trust can be based on direct experience
- What if two people want to do business but have never met or communicated before? How can they establish a level of trust?
  - Via indirect experience or recommendation
  - Trent tells Bob that Alice is trustworthy. If Bob trusts Trent, this trust is transferred to Alice. (Trent acts as a so-called *Trusted Third Party*)



# Information Security

- Information Security is about protecting information assets
- Information assets need to be protected to provide (5 aspects of Information Security):
  - **Confidentiality**
  - **Integrity**
  - **Availability**
  - Authenticity (Integrity of provenance)
  - Non-repudiation (Integrity of action/timeline)
- We need to control who has access to information
  - **Access Control**



## Access Control

- Lack of Access control can lead to **Confidentiality**, **Integrity** and **Availability** (CIA) being compromised
- We need to control who can read, write and modify data
- What is an access control decision in Information Secruity typically based on?
  - Mostly identity
- 2 separate functions:
  - Establish Identity (Identification and Authentication)
    - **Identification:** Determine identity (person or machine)
    - **Authentication:** Verify identity (proof)
  - Authorisation
    - Once the identity of a person is known, a decision can be made about granting or denying access
      - Identity is often linked to a "Role" &rarr; Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
- In Information Security, access control is typically based on **Identity**
- Identification and Authentication are crucial
- It also allows to create an audit trail &rarr; Accountability



## Authentication

> "The process of verifying a claimed identity"
>
> - Authentication provides proof of identity

- How can this proof be provided?
  *(3 general types of mechanisms)*
  - With something you **know**
    - Password, PIN
  - With something you **have**
    - Physical key, token, smart card, ...
  - With something you **ar (or do)**
    - Unique characteristic of human body
    - e.g. fingerprint, voice, hand geometry … (Biometrics)



### Passwords

- Most common method for Authentication
  - "something you know"
- Problems with passwords:
  - Users forget passwords
    - Too many passwords to remember
  - Users choose same password for multiple systems
    - If one system is compromised, all systems are compromised
  - Users choose weak or guessable passwords
    - Problem: Easy to remember passwords are often also easy to guess
  - Users write passwords on Post-it notes and stick them to their computer screen
  - Failure to reset default password

#### Default Passwords

- These days, are there still computers/devices running services with default passwords connected to the Internet? Surely not
- "Carna Botnet"
  - ~500,000 devices compromised via services such as Telnet, with default or no passwords
  - Mostly small (embedded) devices, IP cameras, routers, etc. (IoT)
- Purpose
  - "Internet Census 2012"
  - Internet wide port scan of all IPv4 addresses
  - Collection of huge data set

> "Two years ago while spending time with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) someone mentioned that we should try the classic telnet login `root:root` on random IP addresses. This was meant as a joke, but was given a try. We started scanning and  quickly realised that there should be several thousand unprotected devices on the Internet"
> [http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html](http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/paper.html)

- BTW, `nmap` is a widely used security scanner or "port scanner", used for **"Pen Testing"**



#### Attacks against Passwords

- What are possible attacks to "find" a user's password?
- Password guessing
  - Brute force, dictionary attacks
  - Online, offline
- Social Engineering
  - You get a phone call from somebody claiming he/she is the sysadmin and needs your password to reset your account
    - "Phishing attacks" &rarr; get users' credentials (identity theft)
- Eavesdropping
  - Some (insecure) applications send password in cleartext over the network (ftp, telnet, http) &rarr; "Network sniffer", e.g. *wireshark*
- "Shoulder surfing"
  - Somebody is watching you when you enter the password
- Bogus (fake) Interface
  - Attack program looks like normal login screen and records login and password of users
  - Windows has a **"secure attention sequence"**: CTRL-ALT-DEL
  - Guaranteed to go to genuine login screen
  - A facility that guarantees a user is talking to the real system is called a **"Trusted Path"**
    - If you are security conscious, it's a good idea to always press `CTRL-ALT-DEL` before you log in
- Key stoke loggers, or "keyloggers"
  - Record everything you type on your keyboard, including passwords
  - Can be hardware or software based
  - Can be distributed as a Malware
- Attacks via Audit Trail
  - Systems typically log failed password attempts
  - Contain a lot of passwords, since users get login, password sequence mixed up
  - Non-existent user names like *e5gv*, *8yp* are likely to be valid passwords
  - &rarr; restrict access to log files

#### Attacks against Password Storage

- Problem:
  - Passwords need to be stored somewhere, needed by the system during login process
    - &rarr; vulnerability
- Originally, computer passwords were stored in plaintext, i.e. unencrypted
- How can we solve this problem?
  - Solution by Needham and Guy
    - Store "encrypted" passwords
- What is the problem with using standard encryption?
  - Passwords need to be decrypted with a secret key when users log in
  - At that stage, password (or key) is vulnerable
  - Also, how so we store the secret key?
- Solution:
  - Store a **cryptographic one-way hash** of password $p: h(p)$
  - Access to $h(p)$ allows the OS to verify the password
  - Access to $h(p)$ does not allow finding $p$
  - **Cryptographic one-way hash functions** are a very important building block for a large number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols



## Cryptographic (One-way) Hash Functions

- A **hash function** $h()$ is a function with the following two properties
  - **Compression:** $h()$ maps an input $x$ of arbitrary finite bit length to an output $h(x)$ of fixed, typically short, bit length
  - **Ease of computation:** Given $h()$ and an input $x$, it is easy to compute $h(x)$
- A **one-way hash function** has the additional **one-way property**
  - For essentially all outputs $y=h(x)$, it is "computationally infeasible" (practically impossible) to find $x$
  - Also called "pre-image resistance"
- A **cryptographic one-way hash function** is a one-way hash function with the additional property of =="Collision Resistance"==
  - "Strong Collision Resistance"
    - It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ so that $h(x_1) = h(x_2)$
  - "Weak Collision Resistance" or "2^nd^-pre-image resistance"
    - For a given output $y=h(x_1)$, it is infeasible to find another input $x_2$ so that $h(x_1)=h(x_2)$
      - This is harder than in the above case, therefore resistance to this is only a "weak resistance"
- Collision resistance is crucial for the security of algorithms and protocols, e.g. digital signatures
- Also called "digest function" or "digital fingerprint"
- Examples:
  - md5 (message digest) — output is 128 bits
  - SHA-1 ("secure" hash algorithm) — output is 160 bits
- A cryptographic hash function is considered "broken" if collisions can be found with significantly less work than brute force
- Both md5 and SHA-1 are considered broken
- Algorithms considered (practically) secure, so far:
  - SHA-2
    - Different bit lengths, up to 512 &rarr; SHA-512
  - SHA-3
    - Announced the **Keccak Algorithm** as the winner of the 5 year NIST *(National Institute for Standards and Technology)* competition, October 2012



### An Ideal Model of a Cryptographic One-way Hash Function

- A machine with an input and an output
- There is an "Elf" inside the machine, who has:
  - A very long piece of paper
  - A pen
  - An unbiased coin
- When input arrives:
  - Has this input arrived before?
    - Yes: give same output as last time (required by any function)
    - No: toss coin for new output (one toss per bit); record input and output
- Everyone has access to this machine
- This ideal model is called a **"Random Oracle Model"** and is often used to proof certain properties of cryptographic systems
- Important property:
  - Similar but not identical input files will most likely result in completely different hash values



### Pre-image Attack

- "Work factor" to find a "pre-image", for a n-bit hash function (random oracle model)
  - i.e. for a ==given output $h(x_1)$== find $x_2$ so that $h(x_1)=h(x_2)$
  - Under the random oracle model, what's the best approach to find a pre-image?
    - "brute force" attack i.e. randomly trying different inputs
- Inputs are randomly mapped to outputs. There are $2^n$ possible outputs
- On average, how many different inputs do we have to try to find a collision?
  - On average, we can expect to find a pre-image after trying **2^n^** different inputs
    - work factor
  - This is like throwing $2^n$ sided dice. For $n=3$, we have an 8 sided dice. On average, we have to roll the dice 8 times to get a particular result
  - Due to the random mapping, randomly picking inputs is like randomly picking the outputs
- For $n=128$ and if we use 1 billion computers that can compute 1 billion hash values a second each, how long will it take on average to find a pre-image, for $h(x_1)$, i.e. an input $x_2$ for which $h(x_2)=h(x_1)$?
  - About 20,000 billion years



### Collision Attack

- Finding a collision *between any two inputs*:
  - "Collision Attack"
  - Harder or easier than pre-image attack?
    - Much, much easier than pre-image attack
  - Work factor: $2^\frac{n}{2}$ (Birthday Paradox)



### Finding Hash Collisions or Pre-images

- How can you (legally) make money finding hash collisions/Pre-images
- Bitcoin mining
  - Finding an input with the first $n$ bits of the hash output being a specific value ("proof-of-work")
  - Can adjust difficulty by changing $n$
- A lot of effort has gone into building efficient systems for calculating hashes

#### Possible Attacks using Hash Collisions (Pre-images)

- Most digitial signature algorithms involve hashing a file before a signature is applied
  - For performance reasons
- Let's assume Alice has a file $F1$ that she wants to digitally sign. She computes $h(F1)$ and then computes the signature
  - $sig(h(F1))$
- How can Bob use a pre-image attack to create a fake signature?
  - He can find a file $F2$ with $h(F1)=h(F2)$
  - He can then present $F2$ together with Alice's signature $sig(h(F1))=sig(h(F2))$ and claim that she signed the file $F2$



# Authenitcation Protocols

## Password-based Authenication Protocols

- Authenication over the network
  - e.g. remote login, authentication to web server
- How can we do this in the most basic way?

### Challenge-Response Protocol

- Server gives client a "challenge", $c$
  - Often called a "nonce" *(number used once)*
- Client calculates a response, which is a cryptographic one-way hash of $c$ and password $p$
  - $r=h(c\mid\mid p)$ or $r=h(c\oplus p)$
    - "||" means concatenation
  - Client sends $r$ back to server
- Server can check calculation
- Eavesdropper can see $c$ and $r$,
  - but cannot derive $p$
  - Replay attack is not possible

### Choice of Challenge

- Consider a challenge response protocol where the server selects the challenge deterministically and predictably
- Example:
  - c1 = 1, c2 = 2, c3 = 3, ...
  - Response:
    - $r=h(c_i\mid\mid p)$
- Problem?
  - Doesn't the challenge have to be random and unpredictable?
- The main requirement is that $c$ is not being reused (i.e. a nonce)
- The ability to predict $c$ does not give an attacker an advantage
  - Only if $c$ is reused can attacker launch replay attack

### HTTP Authenication

- Good and simple with digest. But still possible to dehash the password (uses MD5 which is considered broken)
- Password is still stored in plaintext on the server

### SSH Authenication

- Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol
- Supports several methods
  - Password
  - Public Key
  - ...
- Password Authenication
  - SSH establishes an encrypted channel between client and server
  - Then, the password (not hash) is sent across this secure channel
  - Limitation
    - Vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attack
    - Problem: lack of authentication when establishing secure channel
- Public Key Authentication
  - Not vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attack
  - Will discuss Public key crypto later

#### SSH-2 Authenication

- SSH-1 is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
- SSH-2 uses stronger key exchange:
  - Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange for the SSH Transport Layer Protocol
  - RSA Key Exchange for the SSH Transport Layer Protocol
  - Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Authentication and Key Exchange for the SSH Protocol
  - AES Galois Counter Mode for the SSH Transport Layer Protocol
  - Elliptic Curve Algorithm Integration in the SSH Transport Layer
  - SHA-2 Data Integrity Verification for the SSH Transport Layer Protocol
- Supports several authentication methods
  - Password
  - Public Key
  - keyboard-interactive (RFC 4256): e.g. S/Key or SecurID
  - GSSAPI



### Lamport's Hashed Password Scheme

- Application of cryptographic one-way hash function for secure Authenication
- Idea: Create a sequence or chain of **one-time** passwords using a **one-way** hash function
- Used in "S/Key" scheme, by Bellcore 1994
  - Defined in RFC 1760 and RFC 2289
  - Available for most Operating Systems, but less often used these days
- How do one time passwords (OTPs) work?
  - Each password is only used once, no reply attack possible
- Client selects initial secret password $p_0$ (seed value)
- Compute sequence of hash values
  - $p_1=h(p_0)$
  - $p_2=h(p_1)=h(h(p_0))$
  - $p_3=h(p_2)=h(h(h(p_0)))$
  - ...
  - $p_n=h(p_{n-1})$
  - $p_{n+1}=h(p_n)$
- Store $p_{n+1}$ at server with counter $n$
- When user logs in, server sends $n$ as a challenge
- User sends $p_n$, server calculates $p_{n+1}=h(p_n)$ and compares it with stored value $p_{n+1}$
  - If correct, user is authenticated
- Server decrements $n$ by one
- Next time, user needs to send password higher up in the list
- Eavesdropper observing $p_n$ cannot computer $p_{n-1}$, required for next authentication
  - One-way nature of hash function
- No need to store password at the server!



## Multi-factor Authenication

- Authenication: based on something you **are**, **know** or **have**
- If a higher level of security is required, two or three mechanisms are combined. Most commonly, two factors are used:
  - **Two-factor authenication**
- Something you **know** and something you **are**
  - e.g. Password and fingerprint
- Something you **know** and something you **have**
  - e.g. Password and physical key
- Something you **are** and something you **have**
  - e.g. Fingerprint and a physical key



# Biometrics

- Biometrics comes from the Greek words **bios** (life) and **metrikos** (measure)
- Authentication based on **something you are**
  - Characteristics of the human body, behaviour

> "Biometrics is the set of automated methods to recognise a person based on physiological or behavioural characteristics"
> Biometric Consortium

## Criteria for a good biometric

- **Universality** — Each person should have the characteristic
- **Distinctiveness** — Any two persons should be sufficiently different in terms of this characteristic
- **Performance** — The characteristic should be sufficiently invariant over a period of time. Recognition accuracy (and speed)
- **Acceptability** — Extent to which people are willing to accept Biometric in their daily life
- **Circumvention** — How easily the system can be tricked

## Types of Biometrics

- **Physiological:** Something you are
  - Fingerprint, Retina, Iris, Face
- **Behavioural:** Something you do
  - Signature, Voice, Gait, Keystroke dynamics

## Enrolment

- A biometric system is a pattern recognition system
- Users need to ==enrol==
  - Biometric data is ==scanned==
  - Features are extracted
    - Instead of storing the image of a fingerprint, only a "feature vector" describing the key characteristics is stored (highly compressed)
  - ==Feature Vector== ("==template==") is stored in database, together with identity of user

### Verification Mode

- A biometric system can operate in 2 modes
  - **Verification Mode**
    - User Bob identifies himself, e.g. via a PIN
    - Biometric is scanned and compared with Bob's template in database
    - System answers the question: *"Does this Biometric belong to Bob?"*
    - One-to-one match

### Identification Mode

- User is not required to claim identity
- System tries to answer the follow question: *"Whose biometric is this?"*
- One-to-N match
- Identification is harder, more error prone
  - The larger $N$, the higher the probability of an error



## What can go wrong?

- Two main types of errors:
  - ==False Accept (False Match)==
    - FAR: False Acceptance Rate
    - FMR: False Match Rate
  - ==False Reject (False Non-Match)==
    - FRR: False Rejection Rate
    - FNMR: False Non-Match Rate
- In addition: Failure to Enrol (FTE)
  - Low quality input, which does not allow the creation of a valid template

### Errors in Biometric Systems

- Why can errors happen (e.g. fingerprints)?
  - Sensor noise
  - Different characteristics of sensors
  - Dry fingers
  - Changes in user's physiology, bruises, cuts...
  - Ambient conditions, temperature, humidity
  - User interaction, finger placement



## Matching Score

- Scanned data and feature vector for the same person vary due to
  - Sensor noise, ambient conditions, user interaction...
  - These factors are to a large degree ==random==
- The **matching score** $S()$ for a particular measured feature can be modelled as a **random variable**
- (Continuous) Random variables are defined through?
  - their probability density function (pdf)
  - can be determined through measurements

### Matching Score pdf

- In Biometrics, random effects such as sensor noise, ambient conditions, user interaction etc. influence scanned feature vector
- The **matching score** $S()$ can be modelled as a **random variable** $X$ and a corresponding *pdf*
- The pdf can be determined through measurements
- The pdf of the matching score differs for **genuine users** and **imposters**
- Conditional pdf
  - $p(s\mid\text{genuine user})$
  - $p(s\mid\text{imposter})$



## Performance of Biometric Systems

- **False Match:**
  - $S()$ of imposter can get over theshold
- **False Non Match:**
  - $S()$ of genuine user can drop below threshold
- We can tune the system by adjusting the threshold $t$
  - What's the effect of lowering it?
    - FMR increases
    - FNMR decreases
  - What's the effect of increasing $t$?
    - FMR decreases
    - FNMR increases

### FMR-FNMR Trade-off

- Different Applications choose different operating points $t$ i.e. different FMR-FNMR trade-off levels
- How would you choose threshold $t$ for the following applications
- High security applications, e.g. access control for highly sensitive information?
  - False Match would be a disaster
  - We can accept a few False Non Matches
  - &rarr; high threshold $t$
- Forensic Applications, e.g. matching fingerprints from crime scene with fingerprint database
  - Low FNMR is important
  - Here, it is important to "cast the net wide", and not let a potential criminal go undetected
  - A relatively high FMR can be dealt with by considering other evidence
  - &rarr; low threshold $t$
- By adjusting $t$ we can trade off FMR for FNMR
  - Low $t$ means high FMR and low FNMR
    - Easier for imposters to gain access, fewer genuine users rejected
  - High $t$ means low FMR and high FNMR
    - Fewer imposters accepted, more genuine users rejected



## Limitations

- Biometrics can improve security of Authenication
- But, the technology has limitations
  - Error rates
  - Circumvention
  - Revocation
    - What if biometric information is leaked, e.g. fingerprint, DNA, etc
    - Cannot easily be revoked or "reset", such as passwords
- Biometrics is unlikely to replace passwords in the near future, but rather complement them
  - Multi-factor authentication



# InfoSec

## Hash Functions — Digital Signing

- From RFC1319 *The MD2 Message-Digest Algorithm:
  - <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1319>
  - "The algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit ==fingerprint== or ==message digesat== of the input."
  - "It is ==conjectured== that it is ==computationally infeasible== to produce two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message having a given respecified target message digest."
  - "The MD2 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must be ==compressed== in a secure manner before being signed with a private key under a public-key cyrptosystem such as RSA."

# Computer Based Access Control

- We assume user has been authenticated
- How does an Operating System control access to resources (files, printer, memory, database record, network, etc)?
- Fundamental access control model:
  - ==Subject:== active party
    - e.g. user, process
  - ==Object:== passive party
    - e.g. file
    - Roles of object and subject depend on situation, can be reversed
      - Subject can become object and vice versa
  - ==Reference Monitor:== grants or denies access



## Access Control (Authorisation) Policy

- Access Control Policy specifies what ==subjects== can do with ==objects==
- What are the basic operations that can be applied to objects (e.g. files)?
  - Read
  - Write
  - Execute
  - Append (excludes Read access)
  - Delete
- Access Control Policies are rarely implemented directly as Access Control Matrices
- It can be hard to maintain for large number of objects and subjects, especially in a dynamic environment
  - e.g. for 10000 objects and 1000 subjects, we have a matrix with 10 Million entries
- Alternatives?
  - Store the access rights with the objets
    - **Access Control Lists (ACL)**
  - Store access rights with the subjects
    - **Capabilities**

### Access Control Lists (ACL)

- Access rights are stored with objects
- Columns of Access Control Matrix **(including user names in first column)**
- Advantage:
  - Easy to see who has access to specific objects
- How about getting an overview of access rights of an individual users?
- How can access rights of an individual users be revoked?
  - Need to search through all ACLs &rarr; expensive operation
- Managing access rights of a large number of individual users (subjects) via ACLs can be tedious
- Groups (or Roles)
  - Users (subjects) with similar access rights are aggregated in groups and access permissions are given to groups
  - Some policies allow membership to multiple groups, others not
  - Groups can be defined according to roles
    - e.g. in a Bank: teller, branch manager, branch accountant
  - Access rights can be revoked by removing a user from a group




## Unix Access Control

- Traditional Unix systems provide a limited form of ACLs
- The owner of each ==file== (and root) can specify
  - Access rights ("permissions") for the ==owner==
  - Access rights for people in the same ==group==
  - Access rights for ==everyone else== ("other", "world")
- Each access right is a combination of
  - **R** — allowed to read the file
  - **W** — allowed to write to the file
  - **X** — allowed to execute the file
- Sample permission (9 bits for access rights):
  - `-rwxr-x--- bill students thefile`
    - First letter indicates if **directory (d) or normal file (-)**
    - Letters 2-4: ==Owner== (Bill) can read, write, execute
    - Letters 5-7: ==Group== (student) can read and execute
    - Letters 8-10: ==World== (everyone else) has no access
- Windows uses a similar system, with slightly more fine grained control
- In Unix, everything is treated as a file. (directories, interprocess communication channels, etc)
- More recent versions of Unix (e.g. Linux) implement full ACL functionality
- Files are not accessed directly by users, but by ==processes== started by users
- Normally, a process has the **ID** and **access rights** of the user who starts it
- How can users change their own passwords, which requires updating the password hash?
  - Use the `passwd` program
    - But, if run by the user, `passwd` has typically no write access to the password file

### SUID (SGID) Feature

- "Set User Id" (SUID) feature
  - (SGID &rarr; set group ID)
  - Executable files can be set to run, not with the user's ID (privileges), but with its **owner's** ID (priviledges).
    - &rarr; SUID bit is set, indicated with letter 's' in place of 'x'
    - `-rwsr-xr-x root root /usr/bin/passwd`
    - `passwd` executes with permissions of owner, i.e. root in this case
    - Has the rights to update `/etc/shadow` file

### SUID Vulnerability

- Often, SUID programs are owned by *root*
  - &rarr; have unrestricted access
- Possible attack exploiting this?
  - Attacker can try to gain control of such a SUID program and make it execute arbitrary code, with unrestricted access
- How can this be done?
  - Complex programs are rarely bug free
  - Bugs can allow execution of arbitrary code
- Pre-eminent attack &rarr; =="Buffer Overflow Attack"==
  - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow>
- SUID can be dangerous if used carelessly



## Principle of Least Priviledge

- Very important general principle in information security

> "Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job."
>
> 	- Jerome Saltzer



## Capabilities

- Capabilities are an alternative to ACLs for managing access rights
- A **capability** is an (object — rights) pair
- Access rights are stored with subjects &rarr; Rows of Access Control Matrix

| Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easy to see permission of an individual users | Hard to see who has access to a particular object            |
| Easy to revoke access for a particular user   | Harder to revoke access to a particular object &rarr; must find all tickets |

- Rarely used in practical systems
  - Mostly relevant in OS research
  - Example Systems: Hydra, StarOS, Amoeba, L4, ...

## Types of Access Control

### Ownership

- Who has control of defining access rights?
- Who defines in UNIX/Windows the access rights to files?
  - Typically the owner of the files
  - **"Discretionary Access Control" (DAC)**
    - i.e. "at the discretion of the owner"
  - Exception: Which access control rule cannot be defined by the owner of a file in Unix?
    - Superuser ("root") has generally unrestricted access
- Alternative
  - System-wide policy defines access to objects
  - **"Mandatory Access Control"**
  - Often used in military and other high security contexts



## Problems of DAC

- Suppose Bob has access to a *top secret* file $F$. Trudy does not have access to $F$ but would like to.
- What can Trudy do to gain access to the file?
  - She can ask Bob to send it to her or give her access permission
    - *("Assuming Bob collaborates")*
  - She can trick Bob and the system into giving her access
  - She can write a program that does two things
    - It executes the following sequence fo commands
      1. Create a new file $F2$
      2. Grant Bob write access to $F2$
      3. Grant Trudy read access to $F2$
      4. Copy content of $F$ to $F2$
    - Trudy sends Bob the program and tells him he should try it, e.g. pretending it is a new game
    - When Bob runs the program, it has all of Bob's access rights and executes the above 4 commands &rarr; Trudy gets access to the content of $F$, now stored in $F2$
- The problem is that programs (and users) cannot be trusted
  - Especially not those programs downloaded from untrusted sources
  - The program may perform additional functions unknown to the user
- This type of program (malware) is referred to as a ==Trojan (Trojan Horse)==
- Discretionary Access Control is insufficient to protect against these kind of attacks
  - programs cannot be analysed for all possible unexpected behaviours
- DAC cannot prevent users with access to highly sensitive information from sharing it with others, voluntarily or involuntarily
- In high security context, e.g. Military, Government, **Mandatory Access Control** is used



## Mandatory Access Control (MAC) — Multi-level Security

- Each file (object) has a **classification**, i.e. a label indicating its sensitivity level
  - e.g. Confidential &rarr; Secret &rarr; Top-secret
- Each user (subject) has a **clearance**, indicating the sensitivity level of objects he/she has access to
- A user can only access an object if his/her clearance is equal or higher than the classification of the object
  - We say, the **clearance** =="dominates"== the **classification**
- Classifications and Clearances are assigned by the system/management. Users have no discretion about who can access which information
  - Mandatory Access Control
  - Also known as =="Multilevel Security"==



## Categories — Compartments

- Somebody with clearance "secret" has access to all documents of classification "secret"
  - This is often not necessary
- Principle of Least Privilege, or "Need to know"
  - Users should only have access to information necessary to do their job
- Categories within classification levels
  - Known as **compartments**



## Compartments

- Users only have access to their level of classification within their assigned compartments
- Allows more fine grained access control &rarr; implementation of =="Need to know"==

### SELinux

> "NSA Security-enhanced Linux is a set of patches to the Linux kernel and some utilities to incorporate a strong, flexible **mandatory access control (MAC)** architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel…"
> Integrated into the Linux kernel since version 2.6, 2003

# Security Models

## Lattice-based Access Control Model

- Elements of a Lattice Model
  - An ordered sequence of **sensitivity levels**
  - A set of **compartments** (sometimes called *codewords*)
  - A **"dominates" relation**, written &geq;
- Nodes in a lattice consist of a sensitivity label and a set of compartments
- Example:
  - {secret, Nuclear}, {secret, Crypto}, {secret}, {top-secret, Nuclear}
- Some of these are comparable, others are not
  - Example:
    - {top-secret} &geq; {secret}
    - {top-secret, Nuclear} &geq; {secret, Nuclear}
    - {top-secret, Crypto} ?? {secret, Nuclear}
      - *No dominance relationship*
- To have access to an object, a subject needs to have the necessary **clearance** and **compartment**

### Properties of a Lattice

- A, B are nodes in a lattice, i.e. classification, compartment-set pair
  - A &geq; B and B &geq; C &rarr; A &geq; C (==transitivity==)
  - A &geq; A (==reflexivity==)
  - A &geq; B and B &geq; A &rarr; A = B (==antisymmetry==)
- Partial ordering
  - Not every two elements need to be comparable
  - For every A and B, there exists a greatest lower bound
  - For every A and B, there exists a least upper bound



## Bell-LaPadula (BLP) Model

- Goal:
  - A formal (mathematical) model of a security policy
  - For Government and Military applications
- Developed in early 1970s, funded by DoD in the US
- Motivation: multi-user systems
  - Alternative: Separate machines for each level of classification
- Each user has a **clearance**
- Each process operating on behalf of a user is a subject
  - A process's clearance may be lower than its owner's clearance if the user wants it to be &rarr; "principle of least privilege"
- Each file is an object, and hence has a **classification**
- BLP is concerned about ==confidentiality==
- It tries to prevent information from leaking from a high level to a lower level
  - e.g. users with clearance "secret" should not see any documents with label "top-secret"
- **Two rules to prevent information from flowing "downwards"** (with admittedly silly names):
  - **"Simple Security Property":** A subject can only **read** an object if its clearance dominates the object's classification
    - =="No Read Up"==
    - This is not enough. User (or Trojan Horse) with Top-security clearance could copy a top-security file to a new file with label "unclassified"
  - ***(star)-property:** a subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level
    - =="No Write Down"==

### High Water Mark

- Consider a subject with a **secret** clearance
- The subject has not accessed any files yet
  - No need to be at the highest level
  - Its *current* security level is **unclassified**
- This subject can write to an unclassified file
- The subject now reads a **classified** file
- Its current level increases to **classified** &rarr; It can no longer write to an unclassified file
- Can the subject's security level be decreased to unclassified again?
  - No. This would allow him/her to read sensitive data and then write it to a lower level
- The security level of subjects can only be increased
- We say the current security level is a **High Water Mark**
  - Can only go up

### BLP — Discussion

- Significant security model
  - Important for design of new source operating systems
  - Implemented in Multics
    - OS developed by MIT in 1960s
    - "predecessor" on Unix
- Limitations:
  - Only addresses confidentiality (e.g. not integrity)
  - Does not address the problem of managing classifications
    - How are classifications assigned, changed?
    - How are clearances assigned, changed?
  - Not very practical for standard applications, complex
  - Does not address the problem of **covert channels**
    - "Unintended" communication channel
    - e.g. users can communicate via "modulating" CPU load <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_channel>



# Basics of Information Theory

## What is Information?

- The name of this course is "Information Security"

### Claude Shannon

- Claude Shannon (1916 — 2001)
  - "The Father of Information Theory" and "Father of the digital/information age"
  - First publication of the term "bit"
  - Provided mathematical foundation of electronic communication and cryptography
- Also famous for his "non-academic" inventions
  - Motorized pogo stick
  - Juggling robot
  - The "Ultimate Machine"

#### Shannon's Definition of Information

- Two most significant publications (while at Bell Labs)
  - A Mathematical Theory of Communication (1948)
  - Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems (1949)
- Shannon's definition of Information:
  - =="Information is reduction of uncertainty"==
  - Model:
    - Information is gained by observing the outcome of a random experiment
    - Random variable $X$ with a finite set of values (outcomes) $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$
  - For example:
    - Before tossing a coin, you are uncertain about the outcome.
    - After the toss, there is no uncertainty left about the outcome.
    - The amout of information you gained by observing the outcome is equal to the amount of uncertainty that was reduced.
      - $X: \text{outcome of coin toss}, x_1=\text{"Heads"}, x_2=\text{"Tails"}$

## Measure of Information

- The unit of Information is **bits** (binary digits)
  - Term introduced by Shannon in his 1948 paper
- $I(X)$ is the **average** amount of Information gained from observing the outcome of the random variable $X$
- $I(X)$ is also the **minimum average** number of bits needed to encode all possible outcomes of $X$
  - or the content of the message with the outcome of $X$
- In general, if we are observing a random experiment with $N$ equally likely outcomes of the random variable $X$:
  - $I(X) = \log_2N$
- What is the probability $p$ for each of the $N$ outcomes?
  - $p=\frac{1}{N}$
  - $N = \frac{1}{p}$
  - Now we can rewrite the definition of information:

$$
I(X)=\log_2N=\log_2\frac{1}{p}=-\log_2p
$$



## Information — Entropy

- Often, Shannon Information is also called **"Entropy"**
- Story behind the name Entropy

> "My greatest concern was what to call it. I thought of calling it 'information', but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it 'uncertainty'. When I discussed it with John von Neumann, he has a better idea. Von Neumann told me, 'You should call it **entropy**, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, nobody knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.'"

>   - M.Tribus, E.C. McIrvine, "Energy and information", *Scientific American*, 224, 1971



# Introduction to Cryptography

- ==Cryptography==
  - Literally "secret writing"
  - Science and art (practice) of keeping messages secure
- ==Cryptanalysis==
  - Science and art (practice) of breaking message security
- ==Cryptology==
  - "Secret words" Science of secret communications (theory and mathematics) associated with cryptography and cryptanalysis



## Crpytography

- Primary aim:
  - **Confidentiality:** to allow a sender to transmit a message to a receiver, being sure that nobody else can read and understand the message
- Secondary aims:
  - **Authenticity:** to prevent an attacker from impersonating the sender
  - **Integrity:** to convince the receiver that the message has not been altered in
  - **Non-repediation:** the sender cannot later deny having sent the message



## Cryptographic Algorithms, "Ciphers", "Code"

- The central part of the basic model is the use of two algorithms: **encryption** and **decryption**.
- The encryption of the plaintext $P$ is the cipher text $C$

$$
C=E(P)
$$

- The decryption of the cipher text $C$ is the plaintext $P$

$$
P=D(C)
$$

- In general, we have the identity:

$$
P=D(E(P))
$$

- We have to ensure that only legitimate or authorised users are able to (encrypt and) decrypt
- A simple way to do this is to restrict knowledge of the algorithms to authorised individuals
  - **Keep Encryption/Decryption algorithm secret**
- Problem:
  - This would mean that for every different set of people who wanted to communicate, there would have to be a different algorithm
  - It becomes very impractical to keep using different algorithms — it is rather difficult to invent new ones which are resistant to cryptanalysis
  - It an encryption algorithm gets in the hand of an attacker, we need to invent a new algorithm

### Cryptographic Keys

- Modern algorithms are actually large classes of encryption and decryption functions
- The sender and receiver need to use the corresponding functions
- The "index" of the function is called the **key**
  - The function is parameterised by the key
