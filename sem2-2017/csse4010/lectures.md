## Modern FPGAs
- Millions of usable gates
    - Memory blocks on chip
    - DSP blocks
    - Processors (hard and soft cores)
- Integrated development
    - From 'C' or VHDL

\TODO: add image here for process imag

## How to succeed?

    - Start at high level of abstraction
    - Start simulation as early as possible
    - Make prototypes on FPGAs
- Integrated CAD tools
    - Simulation, synthesis, test, emulation, documentation
- Knowledgeable designers

# Logic Minimization with Karnaugh Maps
## Circuit Minimization
- Algebraic manipulations can be used to simplify Boolean expressions
    - As we've seen, this process is not always easy
- Karnaugh maps (K-maps) provide an easy and visual technique for finding the minimum cost SOP (or POS) form for a Boolean expression
    - This technique has limitations, i.e. works for number inputs less than 7
    - Not good for CAD tools, but good for teaching the idea of simplification

## Truth Tables, Minterms
Consider majority function - output D=1, if at least 2 inputs are 1
| **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **Minterm** | **Minterm number** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | A'B'C' | m_0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | A'B'C | m_1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | A'BC' | m_2 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | A'BC | m_3 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | AB'C' | m_4 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | AB'C | m_5 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | ABC' | m_6 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | ABC | m_7 |
$$$
D = \Sigma m(3, 5, 6, 7) = A'BC + AB'C + ABC' + ABC
$$$

## The Combining Property
- Recall the combining property
$$$
xy + xy' = x (y + y') = x
$$$
- Example:
$$$
f &= x1'x2'x3' + x1'x2x3' + x1x2'x3' + x1x2'x3\\
&= m0 + m2 + m4 + m5
$$$
    - Minterms m0 and m2 differ in only one variable (x2)
        - m0 and m2 can be combined to get x1'x3'
        - Reduced fan in and reduced number of gates
    - Hence, f = x1'x3' + x1x2' (still SOP but not canonical)

### Visualizing the Combining Property
$$$
f(x1, x2) = \sigma m(0, 1, 3)
$$$
| x1\x2 | 0 | 1
| 0 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 |
| 1 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |

Minimum form: f=x1'+x2

### 3 Variable Map
$$$
f(A, B, C) = \Sigma m(1,2,6,7)
$$$
| A\BC | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
| 0 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 | 0 | (lightblue) 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 | (lightblue) 1 |
Minimum SOP is:
$$$
f = AB + BC' + A'B'C
$$$

> Gray Code: any two consecutive numbers differ in only a single bit

| A\BC | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 |
| 1 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 | 0 | 0 |
$$$
f=A'B+AB' (A\oplus B)
$$$

| A\BC | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
| 0 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 | 0 |
| 1 |(lightblue) 1 | 0 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |

### The formal Karnaugh Map Method
1. Choose a 1 element
1. Find all maximal groups of 1's adjacent to that element
    - Note: "box" must be a power of 2 in size
1. Repeat steps 1-2 for all 1 elements
1. Select all boxes for which a 1 is "covered" by only that box
    - These boxes are essential!
1. For all 1's not covered by the essential boxes, select the smallest number of other boxes that cover them
    - In case of a choice, select the largest box!

### 4 Variable Maps
$$$
f(A,B,C,D) = \Sigma m(0,1,2,3,6,8,9,11,13,14)
$$$
| AB\CD | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
| 00 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 |
| 01 | 0 | 0 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |
| 11 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |
| 10 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 | 0 |
$$$
f=AC'D+BCD'+B'C'+B'D+A'B'
$$$

## Terminology
- An **implicant** is a product term in an SOP expression (or a sum term in POS expression)
    - Implicants are always rectangular in shape and the number of 1's covered is a power of 2
- A **prime implicant** is an implicant that is not fully contained in some other larger implicant
![Prime Implicant](sem2-2017/csse4010/implicant.png){75}
### Essential Prime Implicants
- An **essential prime implicant** is a prime implicant that contains a 1 not included in any other prime implicant
    - The minimum Boolean expression *must* use this term
- A **cover** is a collection of implicants that accounts for all valuations in which the function is "on" (e.g. 1)
### Dont Care Conditions
- Many times there are incompletely specified conditions
    - Valuations that can never occur, or for which we "don't care what the device does"
- Modeling such a device requires us to specify don't care conditions in those instances
    - Use X as a value to indicate we don't care what happens
- Don't care situations are often called **incompletely specified functions**
$$$
f(A,B,C,D) = \Sigma m(1, 5, 8, 9, 10) + d(3, 7, 11, 15)
$$$
| AB\CD | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
| 00 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) X | 0 |
| 01 | 0 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) X | 0 |
| 11 | 0 | 0 | X | 0 |
| 10 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) 1 |(lightblue) X |(lightblue) 1 |
$$$
f=AB'+A'D
$$$

## Karnaugh Map Method Restated
1. Choose an element from the "on" set
1. Find all maximal groups (prime implicants) of "on" elements and X elements adjacent to that element
> Note 1: prime implicants are always a power of 2 in size
> Note 2: do not feel compelled to include X's -- use them only when they provide a larger implicant
1. Repeat steps 1-2 for all elements in the "on" set
1. Select all *essential* prime implicants
1. For all elements of the "on" set not covered by the essential prime implicants, select the smallest number of prime implicants that cover them

# Combinational Building Blocks
- Set of basic combinational building blocks:
    - Multiplexers (MUXs) and demultiplexers (DMUXs)
        - As a result, define ACTIVE HIGH and ACTIVE LOW terminology
