# Team Management
## Teams evolve or develop over time
- Forming
    - Who is who?
    - Define goals
    - Work plans
    - Group behaviour and standards
- Storming
    - Who is the boss?
    - Doubting success
    - Polarisation of members
    - Low group morale
- Norming
    - Friendships form
    - Max harmony, avoid conflict
    - Group boundaries
    - High morale
    - Moderate work gets done
- Performing
    - Sorting through problems
    - Resolving conflict -- quickly
    - Identify closely
    - High morale
    - Great deal of work gets done
- Mourning
    - Elated at success
    - Disappointed at failure
    - Relief
    - Celebrate
    - Congratulate

## Task Roles and Functional Roles
- Tasks
    - Technical knowledge
    - Design and creativity
    - Building, writing
- Functional
    - Coordinator
    - Progress monitor
    - Planner
    - Troubleshooter
    - Documenting

# Sustainability Aspects of Electronic and Software Design
## European Directives and Regulations
- **RoHS** Directive
    - Restriction on use of certain Hazardous Substances
- **ErP** Directive
    - Energy-related Products (was EUP -- Energy Using Products directive)
- **WEEE** Directive
    - Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
- **REACH** Regulation
    - Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals

### RoHS
- Restriction on the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    - Lead
    - Mercury
    - Cadmium
    - Hexavalent chromium
    - Polybrominated biphenyls
    - Polybrominated diphenyl ether
- Various exemptions(e.g. does not apply to batteries)

### EPEAT
- Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool
    - Global rating system
        - Mandatory criteria (23) -> Bronze rating
        - Optional criteria (28) -> Silver or gold rating
    - Designed for purchasers
    - Applies to PCs and displays, TVs, Imaging equipment
    - Managed by Green Electronics Council
- Criteria address
    - Material selection
    - Design for end of life
    - Product longevity
    - Energy conservation
    - Packaging

## Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)
- Analyse environmental impact over the complete product life-cycle (cradle to grave)
- Covered in ENGG1100
- Detailed analysis is difficult

LCA methodology -- in brief
====
1. Purpose and Goal
1. For product life cycle (production, transport, use, recycle, disposal):
    - Identify raw materials and energy (source/quantity)
    - Identify outputs and waste streams
1. Quantify impacts of each material, energy and waste
1. Aggregate impact into categories for comparison
1. Interpret results

# Microcontrollers
![Microcontroller Architecture](sem2-2017/engg2800/micro.png)[75]
> Microcontrollers are much easier to use!
> They require less "support circuitry"
![Arduino Circuit](sem2-2017/engg2800/arduino.png)[100]

What should I do now?
====
1. Think about how you would like your device to work
1. Break your product into a functional block diagram
1. Work out how to implement each block with real electronics/mechanics. (Keep breaking things into smaller blocks until this step is possible)
